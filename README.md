# Homework-Code-Refactor
01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor
This is my code refactor assignment. We were asked to change the original HTML, which included many non-semantic
elements, to semantic HTML. Using semantic HTML, the webpage meets accessibility standards. As mentioned, it includes
semantic elements, the elements follow a logical structure, the image elements contain alt attributes, the headings fall
in sequential order, and the title element contains a descriptive and appropriate title.
